			<h2>Interests</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			As an undergraduate student, I have been exploring several fields in order to understand where my interests lie.
			<br>
			As of now, my research interests mainly lie in the fields of <strong>Machine Learning</strong>,	<strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, <strong>Financial Modelling</strong>, <strong> Data Science </strong> and <strong> Fluid Mechanics </strong>.
			<br>
			Here are some of the projects I've undetaken over the course of my stay at IIT Bombay. Some of these are part of
			coursework while others are fun, pet projects. Feel free to explore!

					<h3>Football Result Prediction</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					This is a neural network powered result prediction model for the English Premier League 2019-20. Having analysed more than twelve seasons of head-to-head data along with an exhaustive player rating database, the model predicts football match results. The accuracy achieved of 52%, at the time of writing this, is very close to the predictions of reputed bookmakers. <br> This was a part of the course project for CS 419, although I extended it far beyond the duration of the course. I've also authored a detailed report on the same, if you're interested, you can view it by clicking on the link below!

					<h3>Workout Classification</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				This project analyses a large amount of data collected from personal fitness trackers and tries to predict the activity that the user was performing. An ensemble of machine learning techniques has been used, such as <em>Decision Trees</em>, <em>SVMs</em>, <em>Random Forests</em> and <em>Gradient Boosting</em>. Testing accuracy was decent, about 80%. For more details about the data used and the algorithms employed, please do check out the project report at the link below.

					<h3>Modelling a Gear Casting</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This was a part of the course project for ME 206. The project involved performing simulations using the <b>E-Foundry</b> software to determine the optimal riser and mold parameters for the casting of several industry-grade alloy steel products. The product I chose was a gear. The project was evaluated on the basis of the effects of hotspots during casting as well as feeder aids and other remedial actions suggested. Further details and the project report can be found at the link below.

			<h2>Other Projects</h2>
		</header>
		<p>In a world without pandemics, I would've been working at the <b>THTF Lab</b> at IIT Bombay, designing a fluid flow calibration system for venturimeters and orificemeters.</p>
		<p>I keep trying out many small, fun projects - particularly over lockdown - so do check this section for updates. You can also check my GitHub (using the link at the bottom of the page) for some of the other interesting things I do!
