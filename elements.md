<p> Here's where you can find some of the notes/tutorial solutions/other random stuff that I scribble down during lectures. <br> With the new normal (wth, it's almost gonna be a year) of online lectures, I'm experimenting with taking notes down on a tablet, so the quality/form of notes may be variable, at least initially.<br>
Feel free to use/refer to these, but beware that they haven't been subjected to any more scrutiny than a random glance, and I am not responsible for any errors, howsoever flagrant they may seem to you. In case you find mistakes in the notes (which you, hell yeah, obviously will), please reach out to me, and I will do the necessary. Neither are these notes assuredly complete, so they should not be used as a substitute for live/recorded lectures.<br>
