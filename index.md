Hello there, I'm Aditya, an undergraduate sophomore at IIT Bombay. My major is in **Mechanical Engineering** and my minor is in **Computer Science**. I like wordgames, cycling, listening to music and football. I've also been bitten by the travel bug since I was a child, and there's nothing I'd love better than exploring the world.  
Given that I'm unable to satiate my wanderlust during lockdown, I've been exploring several fun online courses and projects. These days you can find me learning something cool online, watching/playing football (bet you couldn't beat me at FIFA) or sleeping, listed in increasing order of probability.
